          title: ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS)
          descr: "ATLAS is one of the four major experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It is a general-purpose particle physics experiment run by an international collaboration and, together with CMS, is designed to exploit the full discovery potential and the huge range of physics opportunities that the LHC provides. ATLAS scientific exploration uses precision measurement to push the frontiers of knowledge by seeking answers to fundamental questions such as: What are the basic building blocks of matter? What are the fundamental forces of nature? Could there be a greater underlying symmetry to our universe? ATLAS physicists test the predictions of the Standard Model, which encapsulates our current understanding of what the building blocks of matter are and how they interact. These studies can lead to ground-breaking discoveries, such as that of the Higgs boson, physics beyond the Standard Model and the development of new theories to better describe our universe."

          title: CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid)
          descr: "The Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences dedicates its work to theoretical and experimental basic research in the areas of quantum optics and quantum information science. Internationality, worldwide networking and highly actual research topics characterize the institute's work. A particular concern of the institute is the sustainable advancement of young academics, and together with the University of Innsbruck, their integration into the research and teaching program."
